<h1>Definitions</h1>
<h2>Definitions of an algorithm</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer
-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"an ordered set of instructions recursively applied to transform data input into processed
data output, as a mathematical solution,descriptive statistics, internet search engine
result,or predictive text suggestions."</p>
<h2>Definitions of learning</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills
, values, attitudes, and preferences."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"The act or process of acquiring knowledge or skill"</p>
<h2>Defintions of language</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"A language is a structured system of communication used by humans, based on speech and gesture(spoken language), sign,
 or often writing."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"A body of words and the systems for their use common to a people who are of the same community or nation, 
the same geographical area or the same cultural tradition."</p>
<h2> Synthesized Definition </h2>
<p>"A finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions so that a computer can acquire new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills
, values, attitudes, and preferences so as to form a structured system of communication common to a people."</p>
