<h1>Synthesis of Algorithms, Learning, and Language starting with Definitions</h1>
<h2>Definitions of an algorithm</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer
-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"an ordered set of instructions recursively applied to transform data input into processed
data output, as a mathematical solution,descriptive statistics, internet search engine
result,or predictive text suggestions."</p>
<h2>Definitions of learning</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills
, values, attitudes, and preferences."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"The act or process of acquiring knowledge or skill"</p>
<h2>Defintions of language</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"A language is a structured system of communication used by humans, based on speech and gesture(spoken language), sign,
 or often writing."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"A body of words and the systems for their use common to a people who are of the same community or nation, 
the same geographical area or the same cultural tradition."</p>
<h2> Synthesized Definition </h2>
<p>"A finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions so that a computer can acquire new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills
, values, attitudes, and preferences so as to form a structured system of communication common to a people."</p>

<h2>Similarities or Relationships</h2>
<h3>Similarities or Relations between Algorithms and Learning</h3>
<p>Example 1: Values can be stored.</p>
<p>Example 2: Both update</p>
<h3>Similarities or Relations between Algorithms and Language</h3>
<p>Example 1: Syntax and Semantics</p>
<p>Example 2: Dependence on order of statements</p>
<h3>Similarities or Relations between Language and Learning</h3>
<p>Example 1: There is a feedback loop between the two.</p>
<p>Example 2: Language gives ways to approach  and think of understanding and problem solving</p>
<h2>Synthesis of Example 1s:</h2>
<p>The capability(a value or values) of a human to expand and improve an algorithm through instructions formed by the algorithm.</p>
<h2>Synthesis of Example 2s:</h2>
<p>The order of statements and words when describing NLP could update approaches to NLP?</p>
<h2>Synthesis of the Synthesis of Example 1s and Example2s</h2>
<p>Write an algorithm that understands how code can be translated to the intention to how to improve the algorithm's code testing where the starting
place would be. The algorithm instructs the user in natural language and/or code to improve itself and by that language is "understood."</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<h3>Were programming languages inspired by language more than we realize? And how does that help with Natural Language Processing if so?</h3>
<h3>How much importance does language have on learning?</h3>
<h3>Can understanding be in steps or does it need to be in an instant such as the final connection or an image for example?</h3>
<h3>Which languages are closer to programming languages if close is even a relevant description?</h3>
<h3>Can an algorithm return something that is equivalent to a humans final state after language is read by the computer?</h3>
<h3>Can one teach the language itself to find what it is similar to in programming languages? CAN A LANGUAGE LEARN?Is language or the abstractions for language alive?</h3>
<h3>Is it possible to study language, learning, and algorithms as a unified subject?</h3>
<h3>Should algorithms which are put in English or pseudocode be a starting place for a new approach to Natural Language Processing?</h3>
<h3>Does syntax in mathematics help with computers processing natural language?</h3>
<h3>Does understanding need a detailed definition so as to produce its characteristics?</h3>
<h3>What roles does language take in understanding?</h3>
