<h1>Synthesis of Algorithms, Learning, and Language starting with Definitions</h1>
<h2>Definitions of an algorithm</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer
-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"an ordered set of instructions recursively applied to transform data input into processed
data output, as a mathematical solution,descriptive statistics, internet search engine
result,or predictive text suggestions."</p>
<h2>Definitions of learning</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills
, values, attitudes, and preferences."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"The act or process of acquiring knowledge or skill"</p>
<h2>Defintions of language</h2>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>"A language is a structured system of communication used by humans, based on speech and gesture(spoken language), sign,
 or often writing."</p>
<h3>Dictionary.com</h3>
<p>"A body of words and the systems for their use common to a people who are of the same community or nation, 
the same geographical area or the same cultural tradition."</p>
<h2> Synthesized Definition </h2>
<p>"A finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions so that a computer can acquire new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills
, values, attitudes, and preferences so as to form a structured system of communication common to a people."</p>

<h2>Similarities or Relationships</h2>
<h3>Similarities or Relations between Algorithms and Learning</h3>
<p>Example 1: Values can be stored.</p>
<p>Example 2: Both update</p>
<h3>Similarities or Relations between Algorithms and Language</h3>
<p>Example 1: Syntax and Semantics</p>
<p>Example 2: Dependence on order of statements</p>
<h3>Similarities or Relations between Language and Learning</h3>
<p>Example 1: There is a feedback loop between the two.</p>
<p>Example 2: Language gives ways to approach  and think of understanding and problem solving</p>
<h2>Synthesis of example 1s:</h2>
<p>The capability(a value or values) of a human to expand and improve an algorithm through instructions formed by the algorithm.</p>
<h2>Synthesis of Example 2s:</h2>
<p>To be added.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<h3>Were programming languages inspired by language more than we realize? And how does that help with Natural Language Processing if so?</h3>
<h3>How much importance does language have on learning?</h3>
<h3>Can understanding be in steps or does it need to be in an instant such as the final connection or an image for example?</h3>
<h3>Which languages are closer to programming languages if close is even a relevant description?</h3>
<h3>Can an algorithm return something that is equivalent to a humans final state after language is read by the computer?</h3>
<h3>Can one teach the language itself to find what it is similar in programming languages? Can a language learn?</h3>
<h3>Is it possible to study language, learning, and algorithms as a unified subject?</h3>
<h3>Should algorithms which are put in English or pseudocode be a starting place for a new approach to Natural Language Processing?</h3>
